# Fallout 4 hacking mini game
This is my personal (6 hour) attempt at making Fallout 4 hacking mini game, powered with HTML and javascript.

The main focus of this project was to get the game play logic to work.

I chose HTML and javascript, because they were easy to setup with minimal requirements and allowed me to jump into prototyping instantly.


# Requirements
The only requirement for this project is jQuery >= 3.6.0, which is already included in index.html as an external script.


# How to play
Download the repository on your computer and open index.html in your browser. The game is tested on Firefox 90.0.2 64-bit.


# Custom word lists
The word list is a single javascript file, that creates a global variable containing word lists. 

The default word list is similar to that of the game. The list is collected from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/75ma3j/all_possible_words_in_the_hacking_minigame_found/).

When making custom word lists, _make sure that each word list has words that all have same lengths._
